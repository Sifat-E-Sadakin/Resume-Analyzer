1. Project Overview
This project aims to develop a web-based system that leverages AI to analyze user-uploaded
resumes and automatically generate a personalized, professional portfolio website. The system
will evaluate resume content using modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques,
provide tailored improvement suggestions, and output a deployable Next.js-based portfolio site
based on the candidate's profile.
2. Problem Statement
Many graduates and professionals struggle to understand the weaknesses in their resumes and
often lack the technical skill to build a polished online presence. Current tools offer limited
feedback and usually lack personalization. There is a need for an intelligent system that
provides:
- AI-driven resume analysis and suggestions
- Automatic generation of portfolio websites
- Career insights and skill gap analysis
3. Objectives
- Develop an AI module that parses and evaluates resumes.
- Provide improvement feedback on tone, content, and job-fit.
- Match resume content with job descriptions to highlight gaps.
- Generate customizable portfolio websites with deploy-ready code.
- Enable one-click deployment to GitHub Pages or Vercel.
4. Novelty & Justification
- AI-Powered Analysis: Uses GPT-based models to give contextual resume suggestions far
beyond traditional keyword-based tools.
- Automated Portfolio Generation: Transforms resumes into styled, mobile-responsive personal
websites with no coding required.
- Career Matching: Compares resumes with job listings using semantic similarity and provides
upskilling recommendations.
- Research Potential: Explore performance comparisons of NLP models (e.g., GPT vs TF-IDF)
in resume-job matching tasks.
5. Technology Stack
- Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, React
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB

- AI/NLP: OpenAI GPT API, spaCy/BERT (for fallback/local)
- Deployment: Firebase, Vercel, GitHub Actions
6. Deliverables
- Full-stack web application
- Resume parsing + analysis module
- Portfolio generation engine with customizable templates
- Research report with evaluation of parsing accuracy and user satisfaction
7. Expected Outcome
A deployable tool that improves the job-seeking process by combining AI-powered analysis with
personal branding automation — valuable for both academic research and real-world
application.
